=================

The <a href="http://multibit.org">MultiBit</a> Bitcoin wallet software, packaged for Portableapps.com platform

This beta installer uses the original binary files from multibit.org. You can verify their MD5sums or extract the original installation files into the <code>App\MultiBit</code> directory to be sure. Future versions will contain a download module which fetches the recent version from multibit.org. Since this is a software that manages real money, you should be concerned about it's unaltered origin.
